<p>The Belgian Puppet Users Group encourages everyone to contribute to this website.  We follow just some simple rules :</p>

<ul>
  <li>Everything must be puppet related, or related to the Puppet User Community in general</li>
  <li>Adding content to this site is done by filing a pull request against the Github repos</li>
  <li>Without prior notification, we only change the category and/or the tag keywords</li>
  <li>Please file an issue if you find incorrect information, typos etc...</li>
  <li>Posts should be in the right format</li>
</ul>

<p>It is not our intention to make another fancy website about puppet, but to be able to share related information.</p>
<p>Information about the system is here <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/">Jekyll Introduction</a></p>

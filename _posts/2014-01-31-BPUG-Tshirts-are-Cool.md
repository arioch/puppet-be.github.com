And the arrived just in time.  Well, thirsday I got the message on our chat, that a box from Germany arrived on my name at our office.  And yes, the 'Belgian Puppet Users Group' has now a cool tshirts.   And we introduced them @ FOSDEM, on the 'Puppet Users Group Stand'.  We even did get an award for them : 'The most expensive shirt on sale on FOSDEM', and i believe we earned that. And yes, we sold a few, very few :).  But we did it with a reason.  You can earn them, by sharing your (puppet) knowlegde and experiences on one of our meetups.

I have to thank [Open-Future] (http://www.open-future.be) for paying the bill for those cool tshirts.

And here are my two biggest fans of puppet, and the Belgian Puppet Users Group : ![BPUG youngest fans] (img/dsci0129.jpg "BPUG Cool Tshirts")

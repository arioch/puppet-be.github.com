And the BPUG shirts arrived just in time.  Well, Thursday I got the message on our chat, that a box from Germany arrived on my name at our office.  And yes, the 'Belgian Puppet Users Group' has now a cool shirts.   And we introduced them @ FOSDEM, on the 'Puppet Users Group Stand'.  We even got an (unofficial) award for : 'The most expensive shirt on sale on FOSDEM', and I believe we earned that. And yes, we sold a few, very few :).  But we did it with a reason.  You can earn them (for free), by sharing your (puppet) knowledge and experiences on one of our meetups.

I have to thank [Open-Future] (http://www.open-future.be) for paying the bill for those cool shirts.

And here are my two biggest fans of puppet, and the Belgian Puppet Users Group :

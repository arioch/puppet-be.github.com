Two new faces showed up at this meetup.  I did prepare some slides about puppet and augeas, but there was nothing much to say about it, so the discussion we had after the 'slide' part was not at all going about augeas.

We did talked about more generic puppet stuff, what stuff happened recently in the open source world, and had some good loughs with some jokes and funny situations we sometimes encounter in our sysadmin life.

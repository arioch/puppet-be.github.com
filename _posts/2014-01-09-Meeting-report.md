This time we held our meeting in a boat, 'De Planck' in Ghent.  This was not a regular meetup, but just a meeting to discuss the practical stuff about coming actions the Belgian Puppet Users Group will be taken part in or organize

**Fosdem - Some practical stuff**
* Puppetlabs has given us three big boxes with t-shirts and stickers for the stand
* The Berlin Puppet User Group brings a demo setup to show something
* Puppetlabs has setup a PUG-Organizer mailing list
* All PUG in the world are asked to write something to introduce themselves, to hand out at fosdem
* A projector and Projector screen will be available
* A list of material (extra power sockets, table cloth ...) will be made
* We asked for photos taken during meetups, so we can show a slide

At the puppet stand, we will keep a list when PUG members can help out with the stand.  So everyone can make a schedule of his visit @fosdem

More info on fosdem will be released as soon as it arrives.  For those that are willing to help out with the stand, please RV SP [at our meetup site](http://www.meetup.com/Belgian-Puppet-User-Group/events/141259432/)

**T-shirts**
* Jan Van Stinkiest designed a Belgian Puppet Users Group Loge, and made some T-Shirts
* We will be printing some more, and are looking for sponsoring.
* No logos of sponsors will be printed on the t-shirts, but will be placed in the sponsor section of our meetup site.
* T-shirts will become available for everyone, after we sorted out some practical stuff.
